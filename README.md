This sdk will generate META that will be used in the next step. As looked in the chart.

### Whitelist IP
Whitelist IP is used to secure your API from unauthorized access. You can whitelist your IP in [here](https://fazpass.com).

### Endpoint Request Body
BASE URL IS : https://api.fazpass.com
#### Check
URL: /v2/trusted-device/check

Check device status & user
```JSON
"pic_id":"anvarisy@gmail.com/62851++++",
"meta":"encrypted"
"merchant_app_id":"7a8s7sadad7a7gas77das7899089as8dasd"
```

#### Enroll
URL: /v2/trusted-device/enroll

Registering user and device as an authenticated user
```JSON
"pic_id":"anvarisy@gmail.com/62851++++",
"meta":"encrypted",
"merchant_app_id":"com.tokopedia.tkpd",
"challenge":"id"
```

#### Validate
/v2/trusted-device/validate

Validating user and device, this will return score and confidence level of security level.
```JSON
"fazpass_id":"fazpass_id",
"meta":"encrypted",
"merchant_app_id":"com.tokopedia.tkpd",
"challenge":"id"
```

#### Remove
/v2/trusted-device/remove

Remove this user & device from authenticated user
```JSON
"fazpass_id":"fazpass_id",
"meta":"encrypted",
"merchant_app_id":"com.tokopedia.tkpd",
"challenge":"id"
```

#### Send Notification
/v2/trusted-device/send/notification/cross-device

Send notification into connected device that already trusted
```JSON

"pic_id":"",
"merchant_app_id":"7a8s7sadad7a7gas77das7899089as8dasd",
"meta":"",
"selected_device":"device_id"
```

#### Validate Notification

/v2/trusted-device/validate/notification/cross-device

Verify if the received notification is valid or not, this will auto enroll user that request send notification.
```JSON

"notification_id":"",
"merchant_app_id":"7a8s7sadad7a7gas77das7899089as8dasd",
"meta":"",
"result":true/false

```

### Handle Response
After you call the API, you will get the response. This should like this
```JSON
"status":true,
"code":200
"data":{
  "meta":"encrypted"
}
```
You need to decrypt the meta using your private key. You can get the private key [here](https://fazpass.com).

### Decrypt Meta
For decrypting the meta, you can use this library

## Meta
Meta is an object that contains information about the user's device.
```JSON
{
  "challenge":"UUID"
  "fazpass_id":"fazpass_id",
  "scoring":90.0,
  "risk_level":"HIGH/LOW",

                         "series":"A30",
                         "cpu":"Mediatek",
                          "id":"uuid"
                           },
                          {"name":"Samsung",
                          "os_version":"Q",
                          "series":"A50",
                          "cpu":"Helios"
                           "id":"uuid"
                            }
                        ]
  "biometric":{
              "level":"LOW/HIGH",
               "is_changed":false/true
              }
}
```
All you need is here. You can use this meta to create your own logic to secure your application.
