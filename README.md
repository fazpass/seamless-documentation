## Preparation
### 1. Choose your stack technology and install it.

| No | Stack Technology | Link 		|
| -- | --	 			| --	 	|
| 1  | Android Native  	| [Link](https://github.com/fazpass-sdk/android-trusted-device-v2)  		|
| 2  | IOS Native		| [Link](https://github.com/fazpass-sdk/ios-trusted-device-v2)  			|
| 3  | Flutter			| [Link](https://github.com/fazpass-sdk/flutter-trusted-device-v2)  		|
| 4  | React Native		| [Link](https://github.com/fazpass-sdk/react-native-trusted-device-v2)  	|
| 5  | Web Browser		| Q1 2024|

This sdk will generate META that will be used in the next step. As looked in the chart.

### 2. Whitelist IP
Whitelist IP is used to secure your API from unauthorized access. You can whitelist your IP in [here](https://fazpass.com).

### 3. Handle Response
After you call the API, you will get the response. This should like this
```JSON
"status":true,
"code":200
"data":{
  "meta":"encrypted"
}
```
You need to decrypt the meta using your private key. You can get the private key in [here](https://fazpass.com).

### 4. Decrypt Meta
For decrypting the meta, you can use this library

## Meta
Meta is an object that contains information about the user's device.
```JSON
